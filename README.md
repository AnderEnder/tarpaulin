Tarpaulin is designed to be a code coverage reporting tool for the Cargo build system, named for the waterproof cloth used to cover cargo on a ship. Currently tarpaulin is in the early development stage and as thus is non-functional. But check out our roadmap for planned features.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Line coverage for tests
- [ ] Branch coverage for tests
- [ ] Condition coverage for tests
- [ ] Annotated coverage reports
- [ ] Coverage reports in the style of existing tools (i.e. kcov)
- [ ] Integration with 3rd party tools like coveralls or codecov
- [ ] Optional coverage statistics for doctests
- [ ] MCDC coverage reports

## Thanks

I wouldn't have been able to make progress as quickly in this project without Joseph Kain's blog on writing a debugger in Rust and C. It's a great read (in progress) so I recommend you check it out [here](http://system.joekain.com/debugger/).
