# Tarpaulin

Tarpaulin is designed to be a code coverage reporting tool for the Cargo build system, named for the waterproof cloth used to cover cargo on a ship. Currently tarpaulin is in the early development stage and as thus is non-functional. But check out our roadmap for planned features.

## Roadmap

* Line coverage for tests
* Branch coverage for tests
* Condition coverage for tests
* Coverage for doctests
* Annotated coverage reports
* Coverage reports in the style of existing tools (i.e. kcov)
